# Event-Sourcing basic example app

Aim: learn basics of event-sourcing pattern and its caveats.

## Notes / TODOs

- [ ] How to make proper relation between Product and Basket?
- [ ] How to access product name when product-related event occurs - aggregate does not expose any state?! (should I access read model from write model?)
